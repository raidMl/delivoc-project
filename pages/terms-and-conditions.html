                                <p> 6.2 Sender may use Delivoc Platform to initiate an Offer of Shipment describing the

                                    as the Traveler is considered jointly liable with the Sender for ensuring overall
                                    legitimacy of the Parcel and the contents thereof across multiple jurisdictions from
                                    Departure Point to Arrival Point. Once the inspection is done, the Parcel should be
                                    sealed and be kept closed with the Traveler until safe delivery of the Parcel to the
                                    Receiver unless the same is opened by the competent authorities. In such case, the
                                    Traveler must immediately report such incident to Delivoc Platform.</p>

                                <p> 7.4 In addition to the matters addressed in Clause 6.2 hereinabove; the Sender and
                                    the Traveler may also have the option to take and upload photos of the Parcel in
                                    Delivoc Platform for Shipment Parties to have access to see the photo of the Parcel
                                    and share any additional descriptions, notes or comments they might have in
                                    connection with the Parcel at any stage of the Service. </p>

                                <p>7.5 Traveler must exert his utmost duty of care in ensuring the safety, cleanness and
                                    wellbeing of the Parcel and protect it from any danger, hazard, theft, loss, damage,
                                    fire, liquid spill, or any other harmful factors whatsoever. </p>

                                <p>7.6 Once handed over, Traveler has no right to open the sealed Parcel during his
                                    journey or tamper with its contents and must hand over the Parcel to the Receiver
                                    sealed and intact as originally received. Traveler takes full responsibility for all
                                    his actions, omissions, and overall behavior in connection with the performance of
                                    the Service. </p>

                                <p> 7.7 All information provided by Traveler on Delivoc Platform must be accurate and
                                    kept up to date. This includes a correct name, address, mobile phone number,
                                    passport copy and other details as Delivoc Platform may require from time to time.
                                    Details entered / uploaded by the Traveler on Delivoc Platform will be visible only
                                    to and between the Shipment Parties. Visibility will end automatically after the
                                    successful delivery and fulfilment of the Shipment and after the completion of the
                                    Feedback Period. </p>

                                <p> 7.8 The Traveler undertakes that he shall never request or accept any direct or
                                    indirect payment from the Sender or the Receiver or any other party, except for the
                                    Service Fee payable officially through Delivoc Platform. Shipment Parties hereby
                                    understand that all kinds of tips, courtesy payments, or circumventive payments are
                                    strictly prohibited, and Delivoc is not liable for any financial loss that may occur
                                    as a result.</p>

                                <p> 7.9 Traveler agrees to revise, amend, and rectify any non-satisfactory Service that
                                    he provides at his own cost and shall not hold Delivoc responsible in any manner
                                    whatsoever.</p>

                                    for the processing and administration related to the Service facilitated through the
                                    Platform.</p>
                                <p>11.2 Users understand that Delivoc may be required by applicable law to collect taxes
                                    or levies including, without limitation, Value Added Tax (VAT). In such instances,
                                    any amounts Delivoc is required to collect shall be subject to all such applicable
                                    taxes and levies.</p>
                                <p>11.3 All services fees and charges applied by Delivoc Platform are in US Dollars, and
                                    the value of which will be determined on Shipment-by-Shipment basis. Sender shall
                                    make payment for the Service by credit card in advance before the start of any
                                    effort or action of the Service. Visa or MasterCard debit and credit cards in USD
                                    will be accepted for payment. Cardholder who makes the payment of service fees must
                                    retain a copy of transaction records and Delivoc’s Terms & Conditions.</p>
                                <p>11.4 Delivoc shall have the right at its absolute discretion to determine the fees
                                    and charges to be paid by the Sender in return for availing the Service in respect
                                    of any particular Shipment. Fees and charges may vary from one Shipment to another
                                    depending on the route, date and time, description and content of the Parcel, and
                                    various other factors. Moreover, Delivoc shall have the right to determine the
                                    portion of Service Fee that will be ultimately paid to the Traveler in return for
                                    successful delivery and completion of the Shipment.</p>
                                <p>11.5 After the payment of Service Fee is successfully made, Delivoc will send
                                    confirmation notice to the payer via email within 24 hours of receipt of
                                    payment.</p>
                                <p>11.6 Delivoc acts as an online escrow agent by way of collecting the Service fees,
                                    holding the same pending the successful delivery of the Service, then either release
                                    the applicable fee to the Traveler in return for Service completion, or hold the
                                    amount in anticipation for future Service, or refund the amount to Sender in case of
                                    failed delivery, as Delivoc may deem appropriate.</p>
                                <p>11.7 Traveler will be entitled to receive his due payment for the Service within (30)
                                    days from the date the Service is proven to have been successfully delivered, and
                                    provided that no concern, compliant, negative feedback, or other issue was raised by
                                    either Sender or Receiver during the Feedback Period. For the avoidance of doubt, in
                                    the event of any unsuccessful, incomplete, unreasonably delayed, or defective
                                    Service in any way or form, or in case of genuine feedback received against the
                                    Traveler, the Traveler will not be entitled to any payment. The foregoing is without
                                    prejudice to Delivoc or other Shipment Parties’ rights and indemnities against the
                                    Traveler for any breach of these Terms & Conditions, or any direct or indirect
                                    losses caused by or attributable to the Traveler’s actions or omissions.</p>
                                <p>11.8 Any and all bank charges for remittances made by Delivoc to any of the Shipment
                                    Parties shall be charged to the payee and/or be directly deducted from the
                                    remittance amount.</p>
                                <p>11.9 Delivoc shall collect and process transaction data relating to each Shipment
                                    processed through Delivoc Platform, including card and other payment data. The User
                                    shall be aware that all online payment transactions are subject to validation checks
                                    by the credit card issuer, payment gateway provider, and/or any competent authority.
                                    Delivoc shall not be responsible if the User’s card transaction is declined for any
                                    reason. All the online charging fees or processing fee shall be added and be borne
                                    by the User/ Sender who made the payment.</p>
                                <p>11.10 All electronic payment transactions are automatically and independently subject
                                    to the terms and conditions applied by the payment gateway provider and/or by the
                                    issuers of the debit/ credit card and/or other parties engaged in the electronic
                                    payment arrangements. Delivoc shall in no event be considered as representative of
                                    any of the aforesaid parties, nor related to any terms and conditions such parties
                                    may choose to apply to their services or any other matters in which Delivoc has no

                                <p>Sender shall have the freedom cancel his order of Delivoc Service at any time prior
                                    to the acceptance of Traveler to provide the Service. In such case, any payment made
                                    by the Sender on account of the Service Fee will be refunded back in full</p>
                                <p>12.1 Moreover, Service cancellation can still be allowed after the acceptance of
                                    Traveler but prior to the delivery of the Parcel to the Traveler, provided that such
                                    cancelation should happen no later than [___] hours before the date/ time on which
                                    the handover of Parcel was supposed to happen. Any late cancellation beyond such
                                    timeline will be subject to deduction of [___%] of the Service Fee as administrative
                                    charges whereas the balance will be refunded back to the Sender.</p>
                                <p>12.2 In the event of Sender’s no-show at the time on which the handover of Parcel is
                                    supposed to happen between Sender and Traveler, the entire Service Fee will be
                                    forfeited</p>
                                <p>12.3 Sender is entitled to full refund of the Service Fee paid thereby in any events
                                    where Delivoc determines that the Service is not delivered due to the default,
                                    breach or misconduct of the Traveler or for any external reason that is not
                                    attributable to the Sender and/or the Receiver directly or indirectly. In the event
                                    Delivoc finds –at its absolute discretion- that Sender and/or Receiver might have
                                    contributed to the non-delivery of the Service in any manner, Delivoc shall have the
                                    right to deduct from the Service Fee any such amount Delivoc deems appropriate to
                                    remedy such contribution.</p>
                                <p>12.4 Refunds will be done only through the Original Mode of Payment i.e. refund of
                                    card payments will be directed to the same credit / debit card through which the
                                    Service Fee payment was originally made. If the Service Fee was paid through a bank
                                    transfer, the refund will also be made through bank transfer to the same bank
                                    account from which the payment came. Any bank charges associated with refunds shall
                                    be borne in full by the beneficiary/ transferee. Refunds should normally be
                                    processed within 45 days from the date on which Delivoc determines that the refund
                                    is rightfully due.</p>
